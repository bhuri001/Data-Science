1. How do you assess the statistical significance of an insight?
Statistical significance is determined by hypothesis testing, where we calculate a p-value to compare against a predefined significance level (e.g., 0.05).
  •	Steps:
      1.	Define null (H₀) and alternative (Hα) hypotheses.
      2.	Choose a statistical test (e.g., t-test, chi-square test).
      3.	Compute the p-value or test statistic.
      4.	Compare the p-value to the significance level. If p<0.05p < 0.05p<0.05, reject (H₀).
  •	Additionally, review effect sizes and confidence intervals to ensure practical significance.

2. What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)? Explain it. Why is it important?
CLT Statement: The sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population's distribution, provided the samples are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).
  •	Importance:
    o	Allows inference on population parameters using sample statistics.
    o	Forms the foundation for hypothesis testing and constructing confidence intervals.
    o	Enables the use of parametric tests even when the population distribution is unknown, as long as the sample size is sufficiently large.

3. What is statistical power?
Statistical power is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis (1−β), where β is the Type II error rate.
  •	High power reduces the likelihood of Type II errors.
  •	Factors affecting power:
      1.	Sample size (larger samples increase power).
      2.	Effect size (larger effects are easier to detect).
      3.	Significance level (α, higher α increases power but raises Type I error risk).

4. How do you control for biases?
•	Bias control techniques:
    1.	Randomization: Ensures groups are comparable.
    2.	Blinding: Reduces measurement and participant biases.
    3.	Matching: Matches participants on key variables to control confounders.
    4.	Standardized protocols: Minimizes variability in data collection.
    5.	Statistical adjustments: Use regression or propensity score matching to adjust for biases.

5. What are confounding variables?
Confounding variables are extraneous factors that influence both the independent and dependent variables, creating a spurious association.
  •	Example: In studying smoking and lung cancer, age may be a confounder if older individuals are both more likely to smoke and develop cancer.
  •	Control methods:
      o	Randomization.
      o	Stratification or subgroup analysis.
      o	Including confounders in statistical models.

6. What is A/B testing?
A/B testing is a controlled experiment comparing two versions of a variable (A: control, B: treatment) to determine which performs better.
  •	Steps:
      1.	Define a clear hypothesis.
      2.	Randomly assign participants to groups.
      3.	Measure the outcome of interest (e.g., conversion rate).
      4.	Perform statistical analysis to evaluate significance.
  •	Common in user experience (UX) and marketing optimization.

7. What are confidence intervals?
Confidence intervals (CIs) provide a range of values that likely contain the true population parameter with a given level of confidence (e.g., 95% CI).
  •	Formula: [point estimate ± margin of error]
  •	Importance:
      o	Offers insight into the precision of the estimate.
      o	Wider intervals indicate greater uncertainty; narrower intervals suggest higher precision.
